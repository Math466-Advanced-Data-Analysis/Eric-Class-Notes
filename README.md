# Eric-Class-Notes
This repository has the jupyter notebooks that I worked through in class about using pytorch. The RNN tutorial is a more heavily commented version of the code, __note__ it is not homework! This is a resource that I made for another class, though it might be a good experience to walk through. If you have any questions, let me know!
